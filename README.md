# HardwareProjects

A showcase of some of the hobby projects I have undertaken over the years. 

Special Thanks to Mike of pachyderm pedals for their [graphics and tutorials](https://www.pachydermpedals.com/tutorials/templates/) on UV printing.

## Shruthi XT

An open-source synthesizer by Mutable Instruments. Straightfoward assembly based on provided PCB files. Provided with metal faceplate/backplate ready for integration into a rack or desktop case. Added optional modifications from the build docs, as well as power switch with quick disconnects for easy dissassembly. 

Experimented with using Arduino for ISP of the microcontroller. Tested waterjet cutting and CNC routing for faceplate fabrication. Text done via laser marking of anodized Al. Custom tall keycaps designed and fabricated via SLS 3D printing. 

Also made a Teensy-LC based MIDI digital/analog converter for easy connection to PC. Done on protoboard as a challenge to use a 1590A enclosure I had around. 

## SVF Out West

A standard second-order active filter design with adjustable frequency and Q and independent LP, BP, and HP outputs. Experiment with surface mount PCB design and UV printing of enclosure. Case artwork by Eric Andersen.

## 555 Tremolo

A tremolo (amplitude modulator) driven by a 555 timer. Adjustable pulse width, shape (square/triangle), and rate.
